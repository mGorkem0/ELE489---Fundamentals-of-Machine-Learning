# ML_HW_1 ‚Äì k-NN Algorithm from Scratch

This project is a homework assignment for the course **ELE489 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning**. The aim is to implement the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm **from scratch** and test it on the **Wine Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## üìä Dataset

- **Name**: Wine Dataset  
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Samples**: 178  
- **Features**: 13 numerical features  
- **Classes**: 3 (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3)

---

## üöÄ What This Project Includes

- Manual implementation of the k-NN algorithm (no use of `sklearn.neighbors`)
- Support for different `k` values: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Comparison of two distance metrics: **Euclidean** and **Manhattan**
- Data preprocessing: normalization using MinMaxScaler
- Confusion matrix and classification report for each configuration
- Visualization: accuracy vs. k plot
